# NLP-Powered Social Graph with Neo4j

This project combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **graph databases** to analyze Twitter data as a social graph.

We use the [Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140), which contains 1.6 million tweets, each labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to:

- Clean and preprocess tweet text
- Extract user mentions and relationships
- Use sentiment to enrich the relationships
- Build and visualize a **social network graph** using **Neo4j**
- Query and analyze the graph using **Cypher**
